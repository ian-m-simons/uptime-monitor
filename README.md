# uptime-monitor

	>this will be a simple uptime monitoring solution
	>most likely it will just ping resources 
	>if successful it will keep running
	>if a resource is unavailable it will set off an alarm
# how to use
	>download and run in terminal
	>currently only works with linux (and likely mac though I haven't tested that yet)

# TODO:
	>input validation for IP addresses
	>consider changing audible alarm for failed ping
	>create option to silence alarm and then later continue monitoring
	>implement OS check so it monitor works crossplatform
